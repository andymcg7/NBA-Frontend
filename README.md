This is the public facing frontend for Northumberland Badminton Rankings &amp; League Tables
It is comprised of a series of AngularJS applications connecting to a basic data access layer.

Back in 2015/2016 when I wrote this, I thought it would be cool to give the different components chilli pepper names. This wasn't a great idea, as I now sometimes can't remember which chilli equates to each real life application....

## Examples
